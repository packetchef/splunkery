Doing some testing of the Splunk API, including asynchronous and synchronous (blocking) searches.  The object names should be obvious.  Each one includes a default main method that, when calling the module file on its own, will create a demo object and show off some methods.  You can otherwise import either module into your own project and instantiate an object thusly.  There are still many to-do's for each module, including adding some input validation, exception handling, and adding documentation in a more Pythonic way.
